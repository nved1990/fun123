Hello! My name is Niharika Ved. I am a product designer by day and budding lettering artist by evening. Please see all my work shown here. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nved1990/fun123/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
